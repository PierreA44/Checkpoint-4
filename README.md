# My Pocket Agenda - Checkpoint 4

## Concept

This project was developped during my last week at Wild Code School.

The goal of this project was to develop a fullstack web application.

For the front-end :

- Mockup web or mobile web user interfaces
- Create static web or mobile web user interfaces
- Develop the dynamic part of web or mobile web user interfaces

For the back-end :

- Set up a relational database
- Develop SQL and NoSQL data access components
- Develop server-side business components

## Setup & Use

### Project Initialization

- Clone this repo, enter it
- Run command `npm install`
- Create environment files (`.env`) in both `backend` and `frontend`: you can copy `.env.sample` files as starters (**don't** delete them)

### Available Commands

- `db:migrate` : Run the database migration script
- `db:seed` : Run the database seed script
- `dev` : Starts both servers (frontend + backend) in one terminal
- `dev-front` : Starts the React frontend server
- `dev-back` : Starts the Express backend server
- `lint` : Runs validation tools (will be executed on every _commit_, and refuse unclean code)

## Resources

You can find in the resources folder :

- wireframes
- database model
- product backlog
